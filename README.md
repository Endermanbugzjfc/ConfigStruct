## Struct Initializing and Caching

### Group

It is quite useless and complicate to implement. In PHPStorm, there isn't an option for overriding properties in the
Generate action.

My opinion, it is better to initialize these kinds of special properties in a constructor rather than writing them in
this weird way.

### Child Structs

Still wasted me quite much time trying to implement.
