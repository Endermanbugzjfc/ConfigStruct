# 2.0.0
Starting from version 2, this library will focus on parsing more than emitting. In API, the number of emit-related classes was reduced to 1 (Emit.php).
## Features
- A cleaner and user-friendly parse errors system had been introduced.
- List (typed-array) had been introduced.
- Child objects can now be recognised in union-types.
## API
- PascalCase had replaced camelCase in namespaces and had become the main choice for directory naming.
- Parse output classes were renamed to parse context.
- StructureError had become a wrapper for another error.
