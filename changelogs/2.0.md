# 2.0.0
Starting from version 2, this library will focus on parsing more than emitting. In API, the number of emit-related classes was reduced to 1 ([Emit.php](https://github.com/Endermanbugzjfc/ConfigStruct/blob/master/ConfigStruct/src/Endermanbugzjfc/ConfigStruct/Emit.php)).
## Features
- A clearer and user-friendly parse errors system had been introduced.
- List (typed-array) had been introduced.
- Child objects can now be recognised in union-types.
## API
- PascalCase had replaced camelCase in namespaces and had become the main choice for directory naming.
- Parse output classes were renamed to parse context.
- [StructureError](https://github.com/Endermanbugzjfc/ConfigStruct/blob/master/ConfigStruct/src/Endermanbugzjfc/ConfigStruct/StructureError.php) had become a wrapper for another error.

# From 2.0.0-BETA1 to 2.0.0
## API
- `ObjectContext::copyToObject()` now returns `void` instead of `object`.
## Performance
- Closures have been set to static if necessary.
